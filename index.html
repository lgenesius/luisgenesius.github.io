					About Myself
				</h2>
				<p class="opening">I was born and raised in the city of Singkawang but now I move to Jakarta to study as a computer science student at Bina Nusantara University. My background in choosing computer science major is that I am a person who is easily curious and has a passion in the world of technology. So, I looked into programming and found that it was interesting to me, then my brother suggested choosing a computer science major at Bina Nusantara University.</p>
				<p class="programming">I see programming as fun and challenging, where there is a sense of happiness when the program we are coding runs and is successful and when the program is not in accordance with what we want or does not work it seems a new challenge emerges that we must resolve. I also like designing UI UX but haven't delved too far in that field. The close project I will do is create a personal website where I can share my experiences and my photography results on the website.</p>
				<p class="fotografi">I have a hobby of photography, especially landscape photography. The city of Singkawang is surrounded by forests and mountains, so usually me and my friends do photography hunting by visiting various places in Singkawang and its surroundings using a bicycle. So, cycling is also one of the things I like to do. I am a fan of photographers like RK from Japan and Marcel from Germany.</p>

				2nd place in the English Debate Competition 2016 in the Singkawang City
			</h3>
			<p class="deskripsi1">
				I was with two of my friends representing SMA St. Ignasius Singkawang to take part in the English debate competition in Singkawang City organized by the Singkawang City Education Office. I act as a third speaker where my job is to provide and add evidence from the first speaker and second speaker arguments. What I can learn from this competition is cooperation and mutual trust, where I trust my two friends, and they also trust me. In the final, we lost to SMAN 3 Singkawang and took second place. Although, we took second place, it will be a memorable experience that we ever experienced. I also give my thanks to my friends and my teachers who also present in the competition to cheer us and support us.

				1st place in the Fashion Show Competition 2017 in SMA St. Ignasius Singkawang
			</h3>
			<img class="fashion" src="Assets/fashion-show.jpg">
			<p class="deskripsi2">
				In 2016, I took part in a fashion show competition at SMA St. Ignasius Singkawang represented the class X MIPA 3, and at that time I lost and did not make it into the top 3. But in 2017, I took part again in the fashion show competition and represented the XI MIPA 3 class with my partner named Cellsya. So, that the defeat in 2016 does not happen again, I practiced hard with my partner such as how to pose, how to increase self- confidence, facial expressions and others.<br><br>Not only the hard work of the two of us, but there was Eric who designed our clothes where at that time the theme was 'Saving The Environment', then there was Milka who did our makeup, there were Delvin, Ega, and many other friends who helped so our class could become champion. The lessons I can learn is not to give up, and keep trying because it turns out that defeat is a delayed victory and of course have to work together and practice hard. The result of the competition was that my partner and I won first place in the fashion show competition. I really appreciate my classmates who really supported us, without them, we might not be the champion.
