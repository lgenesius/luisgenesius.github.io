			<p class="photo-page1-title"><b>"Sparkling at Night"</b></p>
			<p class="photo-page1-description">This was taken at the temple near my house. In the last two years, the temple has always decorated the road as it approaches the Chinese New Year. Lots of people come to pray and usually take photos there like I do. The lantern decorations on the street have always been places visited by many people during New Year. Lantern decoration with a variety of very bright colors at night becomes one of the places that you must visit during New Year in Singkawang.</p>

			<p class="photo-page2-title"><b>"Sunny Hike"</b></p>
			<p class="photo-page2-description">This photo is a picture of my friends who were hiking on the Kutlut mountain in Singkawang with me. I saw a very bright sun and took the initiative to want to capture the moment. Before taking a picture, my position was at the front of the line. Then I headed to the very back position, and let my friend overtake me. Then I took the camera and took the moment.</p>

		<div class="photo-page3">
			<img id="tatung" src="Assets/tatung.jpg">
			<p class="photo-page3-title"><b>"Tatung"</b></p>
			<p class="photo-page3-description">Tatung is a person who is believed to be possessed by a spirit of a god or ancestor. Where the person's body is used as a communication tool or intermediary between the ancestral spirit or the god. This photo was taken at the Budi Dharma Vihara in Singkawang during the 2019 Cap Go Meh celebration.</p>

			<img id="sunset" src="Assets/pemandangan2.jpg">
			<p class="photo-page4-title"><b>"Cycling Sunset"</b></p>
			<p class="photo-page4-description">This photo was taken at a place surrounded by rice fields and has a path in the middle. The right time to take this photo because the sun is right in front of me and my friends when we are cycling and the light from the sun illuminated the rice around us which made the moment very beautiful.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="photo-page5">
			<img id="peace-of-mind" src="Assets/peaceofmind.jpg">
			<p class="photo-page5-title"><b>"Peace of Mind"</b></p>
			<p class="photo-page5-description">This photo was taken in Jakarta. At that time the weather was very bright and I saw a sentence on a wall that read "Peace of Mind". I immediately took the initiative to want to take photos of these sentences and sunny weather. But the road was empty without an object, so I waited for a car or motorcycle to pass so that it could be made into an object and photographed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="photo-page6">
			<img id="sakkok" src="Assets/sakkok.jpg">
			<p class="photo-page6-title"><b>"Sakkok"</b></p>
			<p class="photo-page6-description">Sakkok is a village not far from the city of Singkawang. There is famous for the Traditional Ceramic Industry that has been established since the Dutch era. In that area also surrounded by rice fields that make you amazed if you see the village of Sakkok from a height. Usually to get to Singkawang from the city of Pontianak, it will definitely pass through the village of Sakkok.</p>

		<div class="photo-page7">
			<img id="bike" src="Assets/bike.jpg">
			<p class="photo-page7-title"><b>"My Bike"</b></p>
			<p class="photo-page7-description">This is a photo of my bicycle that I often use to cycle. That afternoon, the sun still seemed to shine so brightly that I decided to take photos. But I needed an object so I decided to make my bicycle as an object to be photographed against the backdrop of the evening's atmosphere.</p>

The Cap Go Meh celebration is a celebration on the 15th day and the last day of the Lunar New Year celebration period. The Cap Go Meh celebration in Singkawang itself is always very lively every year.
